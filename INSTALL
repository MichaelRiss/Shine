How to install Shine

You need:

- the gcc C/C++ compiler
- the gsl (GNU scientific library)

Type "make".
If you have the gsl installed in a exotic place you have to
adjust the INCLUDE and LIBS lines in the Makefile.

That should build 
- Shine
- make3D_C++
- plain2nv/plain2nv

Sorry, no autoconf/automake yet.
